This application allows multiple users to draw on a shared canvas, with multiple options for shapes, multiple colors, and the ability to move shapes/drawings around.

To use: Begin by executing the SketchServer main function. Afterwards, ensure that the server location in the Editor file is correct, and then run the Editor function on any device that you would like to edit with.

Starter code was provided from the CS10 course at Dartmouth College.
